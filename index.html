<h1 style="background-color:Black; color:Lime;">Aurora Borealis: Nature’s Light Show</h1>
<p style="background-color:#FF00FF">The Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, paints the polar skies with ribbons of green, purple, and blue light that dance across the darkness. This celestial phenomenon occurs when charged particles from the sun collide with Earth’s magnetic field, exciting oxygen and nitrogen atoms in our upper atmosphere. The result is a breathtaking display that has inspired countless myths and legends across Arctic cultures.</p>
<p style="background-color:#FF00FF">These luminous curtains typically appear between 60 and 75 degrees north latitude, with the most vibrant displays occurring during periods of high solar activity. The characteristic green glow comes from oxygen atoms at lower altitudes, while rare red and purple hues emerge from oxygen at higher elevations and nitrogen interactions. Winter months offer the best viewing conditions, when long nights provide the dark canvas necessary to witness this natural masterpiece.</p>

<h2 style="background-color:Black; color:Aqua">Bioluminescent Wonders of the Deep</h2>
<ul style="background-color:rgb(173, 216, 230)">
<li>
  <strong>Anglerfish</strong> use glowing lures to attract prey in the pitch-black depths, their bioluminescent bulbs dangling like underwater lanterns
  </li>
<li>
  <strong>Jellyfish</strong> pulse through the water column with ethereal blue and green lights, creating living constellations in the darkness  
  </li>
<li>
  <strong>Deep-sea squid</strong> communicate through patterns of light across their bodies, flashing messages to potential mates or rivals  
  </li>
<li>
  <strong>Lanternfish</strong> migrate vertically each night, creating the largest daily migration on Earth as billions rise toward the surface  
  </li>
<li>
  <strong>Vampire squid</strong> can eject clouds of bioluminescent mucus when threatened, confusing predators with bursts of blue light
  </li>
<li>
  <strong>Atolla jellyfish</strong> create spectacular “burglar alarm” displays, spinning while flashing bright lights to attract larger predators
  </li>
<li>
  <strong>Barreleye fish</strong> possess transparent heads and tubular eyes that rotate upward to spot silhouettes of prey against faint surface light
  </li>
<li>
  <strong>Giant siphonophores</strong> stretch longer than blue whales, their colonial bodies studded with thousands of tiny light-producing organs
  </li>
  </ul>
